This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Hack involving recursive functions.  The functions `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` are recursive functions. The error occurs when the recursive function does not have a proper base case, and the recursion may run indefinitely without termination. This can lead to stack overflow errors. The `bug.hack` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.hack` provides a corrected version.
